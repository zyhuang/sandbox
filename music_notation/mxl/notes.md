see [http://www.musicxml.com/tutorial/faq](http://www.musicxml.com/tutorial/faq/)

* To identify elements, as in measure numbers or beam levels.
* To suggest how an element would best be printed.
* To suggest how an element would best be converted into MIDI or other sound formats.


### about XML

see [https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp)

entity references for characters with special meaning:

* `&lt;` = `<`
* `&gt;` = `>`
* `&amp;` = `&`
* `&apos;` = `'`
* `quot;` = `"`

### about Music XML elements

* `<duration>`: intended note duration, consistent with time signature (e.g. `4`, 4 quarter notes)
* `<type>`: performance duration, may not match `<duration>` due to performance style (e.g. `whole`, a whole note).
